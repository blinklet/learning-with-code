Thank you for reading my blog.

I am a professional electrical engineer currently working as a manager for a large telecommunications company in Canada. As I take on new challenges, I have found that the Python programming language has been useful in automating some of my tasks. Recently, it has become even more useful to me because I am shifting my focus to data analytics and data science.

I started this blog so I could record what I learn about Python. It helps me to have something to look back on so I can re-learn specific Python topics when I need them again. The first few posts on this blog originally appeared on my [Network Simulation blog](https://www.brianlinkletter.com/) but I copied them over to this blog because I want to ensure that my Network Simulation blog can remain focused on its own topic.
