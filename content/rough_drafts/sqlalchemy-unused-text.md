SQLAlchemy-unused-text



[Install Python on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners#install-python) from the *Microsoft Store*. Open the Microsoft Store app and search for Python. Install the latest version. [Python 3.11](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K?hl=en-ca&gl=ca&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab&rtc=1) was the latest version at the time I wrote this notebook so all examples use Python 3.11.




>**NOTE:** If you want to see the actual query, use the SQLAlchemy *compile* function along with the database driver to output the exact SQL statement that is generated by the *statement* object. For example:
>
>~~~~
>from sqlalchemy.dialects import sqlite 
>query = statement.compile(
>    dialect=sqlite.dialect(),
>    compile_kwargs={"literal_binds": True}
>    )
>print(query)
>~~~~
>
>The output is:
>
>~~~~
>SELECT "Artist"."ArtistId", "Artist"."Name" 
>FROM "Artist" 
>WHERE "Artist"."Name" = 'Alice In Chains'
>~~~~



## Database metadata compared to ORM classes

Print the database table metadata using the following statement:

```python
print(*Base.metadata.tables, sep=", ")
```

You should see the output displayed below, showing the table names in the Chinook database.

```
Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, Genre, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, MediaType, Playlist, PlaylistTrack
```

The reason programmers use the SQLAlchemy ORM is so that they can treat database tables like Python classes in their programs and work in the "Pythonic" way. Let's find out some more information about the SQLAlchemy classes that map the tables in the database.

List the SQLAlchemy classes mapped by the automap extension.

```python
print(*Base.classes.keys(), sep=", ")
```

You should see the output displayed below, showing the table names in the Chinook database.

```
Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, Genre, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, MediaType, Playlist
```

If you compare the names found in *Base.metadata.tables* with the names returned by *Base.classes.keys()*, you will see that we have eleven table objects but only ten ORM classes. This is because the *PlaylistTrack* table is an association table. SQLAlchemy ORM does not automatically create a class for an association table. It instead represents it as a table with foreign keys pointing to columns in the other tables.

## Understanding the database schema

You can view more information about the tables declared in the ORM by parsing through the database class's metadata. You can learn the data types of each column. for example. To see a rough listing of all of the metadata for the *Album* table, run the following code:

```python
print(repr(Base.metadata.tables['Album']))
```

You see the following output:

```
Table('Album', MetaData(), Column('AlbumId', INTEGER(), table=<Album>, primary_key=True, nullable=False), Column('Title', NVARCHAR(length=160), table=<Album>, nullable=False), Column('ArtistId', INTEGER(), ForeignKey('Artist.ArtistId'), table=<Album>, nullable=False), schema=None)
```

If you wanted to see metadata for every table in the database schema, run the following code:

```python
meta = Base.metadata.tables.items()
for i in meta:
    print(i, end="\n\n")
```

You can find out any existing relationships between tables by looking at the columns defined as primary keys and secondary keys. The following code will print out table name, column names, primary keys, and foreign keys of any table in an easy-to-read format:

```python
from sqlalchemy.schema import ForeignKey
from tabulate import tabulate

def table_info(table_name):
    headers = [
        'Column Name',
        'Primary Key',
        'Foreign Key', 
        'Relationship'
    ]

    body = list()
    table = Base.metadata.tables[table_name]
    
    print(f"Table: {table_name}")
    
    for col in table.columns:
        line = dict.fromkeys(headers)
        line['Column Name'] = col.name
        
        if col.primary_key:
            line['Primary Key'] = "YES"
        
        if col.foreign_keys:
            line['Foreign Key'] = "YES"
            z = set(col.expression.foreign_keys)[.pop()]
            if isinstance(z, ForeignKey):
                line['Relationship'] = z.target_fullname
        
        body.append(line)
    
    rows =  [x.values() for x in body]
    return(
        tabulate(
            rows, 
            headers, 
            colalign=('left','center','center','left'), 
            tablefmt='psql'
        )
    )
```

Call the *table_info()* function, as shown below:

```python
print(table_info("PlaylistTrack"))
print("\n")
print(table_info("Track"))
```

You should see the two tables described, with each table's output looking like the below text:

```
Table: PlaylistTrack
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------------+
| Column Name   |  Primary Key  |  Foreign Key  | Relationship        |
|---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------------|
| PlaylistId    |      YES      |      YES      | Playlist.PlaylistId |
| TrackId       |      YES      |      YES      | Track.TrackId       |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------------+


Table: Track
+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------------------+
| Column Name   |  Primary Key  |  Foreign Key  | Relationship          |
|---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------------------|
| TrackId       |      YES      |               |                       |
| Name          |               |               |                       |
| AlbumId       |               |      YES      | Album.AlbumId         |
| MediaTypeId   |               |      YES      | MediaType.MediaTypeId |
| GenreId       |               |      YES      | Genre.GenreId         |
| Composer      |               |               |                       |
| Milliseconds  |               |               |                       |
| Bytes         |               |               |                       |
| UnitPrice     |               |               |                       |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------------------+
```

In the listing above, you can [identify](https://condor.depaul.edu/gandrus/240IT/accesspages/relationships.htm) that the *PlaylistTrack* table is an [association table](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/basic_relationships.html#many-to-many) that supports a [many-to-many relationships](https://medium.com/@BryanFajardo/how-to-use-associative-entities-in-relational-databases-4456a2c71cda) between two other tables. A typical association table has two columns and each of its columns are both Primary Keys and Foreign Keys. 

Association tables are declared differently in the ORM than normal tables in the SQLAlchemy ORM. They are not reflected as ORM classes so there will be no *PlaylistTrack* class in the ORM. The association table is defined only as a table object in the ORM.

After looking at all the information output, you should be able to draw a diagram showing the database tables and relationships, like the one below:

# Get data from the database

Up until now, we've been studying information you can get about the database schema and how to automatically define the ORM's declarative base object when working with an existing database. Next, we need to get data out of that database so we can analyze it.

In this example, we will use the [Pandas framework](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to get data from the database. You can also query the database using SQLAlchemy but, since we will use Pandas to analyze data, we will also use it to query data.

## Query data and convert it into Pandas dataframes

Create an SQLAlchemy query and load its results into a Pandas dataframe. 

```python
import pandas as pd

albums = pd.read_sql_table(table_name='Album', con=engine)

print(albums)
```

The output looks like below. 

```
     AlbumId                                              Title  ArtistId
0          1              For Those About To Rock We Salute You         1
1          2                                  Balls to the Wall         2
2          3                                  Restless and Wild         2
3          4                                  Let There Be Rock         1
4          5                                           Big Ones         3
..       ...                                                ...       ...
342      343                             Respighi:Pines of Rome       226

344      345                                Monteverdi: L'Orfeo       273
345      346                              Mozart: Chamber Music       274
346      347  Koyaanisqatsi (Soundtrack from the Motion Pict...       275

[347 rows x 3 columns]
```

The output shows that Pandas successfully [queried the database](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/queryguide/index.html) and saved the query results in a dataframe. Pandas automatically truncates the displayed output if the number of rows or columns exceeds the default length. You can see the default length by executing the following code:

```python
print(pd.options.display.max_rows)
print(pd.options.display.max_columns)
```

You will see the default maximum number of rows that can be viewed is 60 and the default maximum number of columns that can be viewed is 20.

> **NOTE:** If you are writing short scripts, you may choose not to use SQLAchemy to manage the database connection and may instead pass the database connection URL directly to pandas, as shown below:
>
>```python
>url = r"sqlite:///C:/Users/blinklet/Documents/chinook-database/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite"
>
>pd.read_sql_table('Track', url)
>```




# SQLAlchemy query basics

Up until this point, we have been using Pandas to query the SQL database, using an SQLAlchemy ORM select statement that tells Pandas which data to pull from the database. This works well when you want to gather large data sets into Pandas for organization and analysis.

There may be times when you want to read data from an SQL database and receive the result directly, without loading it into a Pandas dataframe. You do this using the [SQLAlchemy's *Session* object]((https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/session_basics.html)). 

Create a new database session named *session* by calling the *Session* class and passing it the *engine* object you created at the start of this document, using SQLAlchemy's *create_engine* method. 

For example, using the SQLAlchemy *select* below as the parameter to the *session.execute* method, get a Result object from the database:

```python
statement = (select(Album.Title.label("Album"),
            Artist.Name.label("Artist"),
            Track.Name.label("Track"),
            Track.Composer, 
            Track.Milliseconds.label("Length"))
     .join(Track)
     .join(Artist)
    )

with Session(engine) as session:
    print(type(session.execute(statement)))
    print(session.execute(statement))
```

You can see that the session.execute method returns a *Result* object, which is a proxy for the data queried from the database.

```
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.result.ChunkedIteratorResult'>
<sqlalchemy.engine.result.ChunkedIteratorResult object at 0x00000173831B5550>
```

The Result object is connected to the database session and gives you access to all the rows returned by the execution of the *select* statement. It does not actually contain data but it sends you data from the database every time you iterate on it. You need to iterate through the result to get rows from the database.

To get rows from the database, use an iterator like a *for* loop or the *next* function. Each iteration returns a *Row* object

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    result = session.execute(statement)

    print(next(result))
    print(next(result))
    print(type(result))
```
```
('For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'AC/DC', 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)', 'Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson', 343719)
('Balls to the Wall', 'Accept', 'Balls to the Wall', None, 342562)
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.result.ChunkedIteratorResult'>
```

Here is an example of iterating through the result using a *for* loop. In this case, I added some code to limit the output to four rows.

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    limit = 4
    result = session.execute(statement)
    for index, item in enumerate(result, start=1):
        print(item)
        if index == limit:
            break
```
```
('For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'AC/DC', 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)', 'Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson', 343719)
('Balls to the Wall', 'Accept', 'Balls to the Wall', None, 342562)
('Restless and Wild', 'Accept', 'Fast As a Shark', 'F. Baltes, S. Kaufman, U. Dirkscneider & W. Hoffman', 230619)
('Restless and Wild', 'Accept', 'Restless and Wild', 'F. Baltes, R.A. Smith-Diesel, S. Kaufman, U. Dirkscneider & W. Hoffman', 252051)
```

When you print a *Row* object, it displays a tuple containing values from each column in that row. But, it is still a Row object so you can get data from any column in the row by addressing it by column name, as follows:

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    result = session.execute(statement)

    x = next(result).Artist
    print(x)
    print(type(x))
```
```
AC/DC
<class 'str'>
```

You can get the column headers from the database and use them to identify table columns in your program. The *keys()* method returns a list of headers, as shown below:

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    result = session.execute(statement)
    headers = result.keys()
    print(headers)
```
```
RMKeyView(['Playlist', 'Track', 'Album', 'Artist'])
```

Another way to get a number of rows from a table is to use the Result object's *fetchmany()* method, as shown below:

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    result = session.execute(statement)
    headers = result.keys()
    table = result.fetchmany(4)

print(tuple(headers))
for row in table:
    print(row)
```
```
('Album', 'Artist', 'Track', 'Composer', 'Length')
('For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'AC/DC', 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)', 'Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson', 343719)
('Balls to the Wall', 'Accept', 'Balls to the Wall', None, 342562)
('Restless and Wild', 'Accept', 'Fast As a Shark', 'F. Baltes, S. Kaufman, U. Dirkscneider & W. Hoffman', 230619)
('Restless and Wild', 'Accept', 'Restless and Wild', 'F. Baltes, R.A. Smith-Diesel, S. Kaufman, U. Dirkscneider & W. Hoffman', 252051)
```

To explore what types are returned by the *session.execute.keys()*, *session.execute.fetchmany()* methods, run the following code:

```python
print(type(headers))
print(type(table))
for row in table:
    print(type(row))
```

We see the following output:

```
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.result.RMKeyView'>
<class 'list'>
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.row.Row'>
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.row.Row'>
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.row.Row'>
<class 'sqlalchemy.engine.row.Row'>
```

From this output, we see

* The *keys()* method returns a RMKeyView object, which can be converted to an interable, list, or tuple using the Python *iter()*, *list()*, or *tuple()* functions.
* The *fetchmany()* method returns a list that contains Row objects, which are similar to [Named Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple). But, when printed, they look like normal Tuples.


## More querying methods

The SQLAlchemy session object offers [several methods for querying](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/session_basics.html#querying) rows or items from a database. You can use the *execute()* method to get a result containing database rows, the *scalars()* method to get results containing single items from each row, or the [*scalar()* method](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Session.scalars) to get the actual value of a single item in a single row.

Below is an example of using the various methods, and chaining additional methods onto either the original statement object or onto the session object.

Given the following SQLAlchemy select statement:

```python
statement = (select(Album.Title.label("Album"),
            Artist.Name.label("Artist"),
            Track.Name.label("Track"),
            Track.Composer, 
            Track.Milliseconds.label("Length"))
     .join(Track)
     .join(Artist)
    )
```

The *session.execute()* method returns a SQLAlchemy ORM Result object.

```python
session = Session(engine)
print(session.execute(statement))
```
```
<sqlalchemy.engine.result.ChunkedIteratorResult object at 0x0000016E8881BBD0>
```

The *session.execute()* method's *first()* method returns the first row in the Result object.

```python
print(session.execute(statement).first())
```
```
('For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'AC/DC', 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)', 'Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson', 343719)
```

The *fetchmany()* method returns the specified number rows and returns them in a list of Row objects.

```python
print(session.execute(statement).fetchmany(2))
```
```
[('For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'AC/DC', 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)', 'Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson', 343719), ('Balls to the Wall', 'Accept', 'Balls to the Wall', None, 342562)]
```

The *fetchall()* method gets all rows in the Result object and returns them in a list of Row objects. In this case, adding the *limit()* method to the statement causes the Result object to have only two rows in it.

```python
print(session.execute(statement.limit(2)).fetchall())
```
```
[('For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'AC/DC', 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)', 'Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson', 343719), ('Balls to the Wall', 'Accept', 'Balls to the Wall', None, 342562)]
```

The *session.scalars()* method returns a SQLAlchemy ORM Scalars object, which, when iterated, looks like a list containing a series of values that come from the first column of each row in results returned by executing the SQL statement.

```python
print(session.scalars(statement))
```
```
<sqlalchemy.engine.result.ScalarResult object at 0x0000016E8886F0D0>
```

The *session.scalars()* method's *first()* method returns the first value from the series.

```python
print(session.scalars(statement).first())
```
```
For Those About To Rock We Salute You
```

The *fetchmany()* method returns the specified number of items and returns them in a list of values.

```python
print(session.scalars(statement).fetchmany(2))
```
```
['For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 'Balls to the Wall']
```

The *session.scalar()* method returns one value from the SQL statement's results. It returns the value in the first column of the first row.

```python
print(session.scalar(statement))
session.close()
```
```
For Those About To Rock We Salute You
```

## Selecting rows

You can create an SQL statement that searches for rows that match a specified criteria, using the *where()* method. For example, below is a script that returns the rows where the artist is "Alice in Chains" 

```python
statement = (select(Album.Title.label("Album"),
            Artist.Name.label("Artist"),
            Track.Name.label("Track"),
            Track.Composer, 
            Track.Milliseconds.label("Length"))
     .join(Track)
     .join(Artist)
     .where(Artist.Name == 'Alice In Chains')
    )

with Session(engine) as session:
    result = session.execute(statement).fetchall()
```

The *result* object is a list of *Row* objects selected from the database based on the criteria in the *where()* method. Print the track name and track composer from each Row object in the list named *result*.

```python
for row in result:
    print(f"Track name: {row.Track:18} Composer: {row.Composer}")
```

The output is:

```
Track name: We Die Young       Composer: Jerry Cantrell
Track name: Man In The Box     Composer: Jerry Cantrell, Layne Staley
Track name: Sea Of Sorrow      Composer: Jerry Cantrell
Track name: Bleed The Freak    Composer: Jerry Cantrell
Track name: I Can't Remember   Composer: Jerry Cantrell, Layne Staley
Track name: Love, Hate, Love   Composer: Jerry Cantrell, Layne Staley
Track name: It Ain't Like That Composer: Jerry Cantrell, Michael Starr, Sean Kinney
Track name: Sunshine           Composer: Jerry Cantrell
Track name: Put You Down       Composer: Jerry Cantrell
Track name: Confusion          Composer: Jerry Cantrell, Michael Starr, Layne Staley
Track name: I Know Somethin (Bout You) Composer: Jerry Cantrell
Track name: Real Thing         Composer: Jerry Cantrell, Layne Staley
```

## Convert an ORM result into a Pandas dataframe

You may wish to perform a query and get a result in the SQLAlchemy ORM and then convert the result into a Pandas dataframe. This allows you to separate your program's database logic from its business logic. 

Instead of building a *select* statement and running it as part of the Pandas *read_sql_query* method, get the ORM result object from the SQLAlchemy session. Then use the [Pandas *Dataframe*](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) class to convert the received data into a dataframe. For example:

```python
statement = (
    select(
        Playlist.Name.label("Playlist"),
            Track.Name.label("Track"),
            Album.Title.label("Album"),
            Artist.Name.label("Artist")
    )
    .join_from(Playlist, playlisttrack)
    .join_from(playlisttrack, Track)
    .join_from(Track, Album)
    .join_from(Album, Artist)
)

with Session(engine) as session:
    results_proxy = session.execute(statement)
    
    headers = results_proxy.keys()
    results = results_proxy.fetchall()

dataframe = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=headers)

print(dataframe.sample(3).to_string(index=False))
```

The output should look like:

```
  Playlist               Track                   Album        Artist
     Music      No Bone Movies                 Tribute Ozzy Osbourne
90’s Music Upon A Golden Horse Walking Into Clarksdale  Page & Plant
90’s Music   The River (Remix)                Tangents The Tea Party
```

# Pandas or SQL?

Data selection, filtering, and manipulation can be done on the SQL database server, using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, or on your workstation, using Pandas. 

In the end, your decision about whether you join and manipulate your data in Pandas or in the SQLAlchemy query will depend on issues like the purpose of your application, the size of the database tables and pandas dataframes, database server performance, and the processing and memory resources available on your workstation.

In my opinion, if your data comes from a database, you should do most of your data joining and filtering using the database and then use Pandas for additional data cleaning and analysis. If your data comes from spreadsheets or CSV files, you have to use Pandas to combine, filter, clean, and analyze data.

## Data analysis using Pandas

<!--fix-->
Use SQLAlchemy ORM to create a joined table containing the data we need for analysis and load that data into a dataframe. 

For example, Load data from the database into a dataframe named *df4* that contains track information, including prices. 

```python
albums = pd.read_sql_table(table_name='Album', con=engine)
artists = pd.read_sql_table(table_name='Artist', con=engine)
tracks = pd.read_sql_table(table_name='Track', con=engine)

df1 = (pd
     .merge(albums, artists)
     .rename(columns = {'Name':'Artist'}))

data = (pd
     .merge(df1, tracks)
     .rename(columns = {'Name':'Track', 
                        'Title':'Album',
                        'Milliseconds':'Length'}))

print(f"Longest track: {data.Length.max():d}")
print(f"Shortest track: {data.Length.min():,}")
print(f"How many blanks in Composer column?: "
      f"{data.Composer.isnull().sum():,}")
print(f"Track length mean: {data.Length.mean():,.2f}")
print(f"Track length median: {data.Length.median():,.2f}")
print(f"Artist mode: {data.Artist.mode()[0]}")
print(f"Correlation between Length and UnitPrice: "
      f"{data['Length'].corr(data['UnitPrice']):,.2f}")
print(f"Track length standard deviation: "
      f"{data.Length.std():,.2f}")
```

Which outputs the following:

```
Longest track: 5286953
Shortest track: 1,071
How many blanks in Composer column?: 978
Track length mean: 393,599.21
Track length median: 255,634.00
Artist mode: Iron Maiden
Correlation between Length and UnitPrice: 0.93
Track length standard deviation: 535,005.44
```

You can also use the Pandas *describe* function to get statistical information about any column in a dataframe. For example, to get statistics about the length of all tracks in the dataframe:

```python
print(data.Length.describe())
```
```
count    3.503000e+03
mean     3.935992e+05
std      5.350054e+05
min      1.071000e+03
25%      2.072810e+05
50%      2.556340e+05
75%      3.216450e+05
max      5.286953e+06
Name: Length, dtype: float64
```

Or, to get statistics about the artist names in the dataframe:

```python
print(data.Artist.describe())
```
```
count            3503
unique            204
top       Iron Maiden
freq              213
Name: Artist, dtype: object
```

You can see that the type of information you get depends on the data type of the column.

Group and select data. You can use Pandas to [group and aggregate data](https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/).

For example, the following code groups the dataframe by Artist and calculates the standard deviation of all the track lengths created by each artist. 

```python
print(f"Track length standard deviation for a sample of artists:")
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
pd.options.styler.format.thousands= ','

display(
    data
    .groupby(['Artist'])['Length'] 
    .std()
    .dropna()
    .sample(3)
    .to_frame()
)
```

The following code displays the three longest tracks in the dataframe:

![](./Images/pandas020.png)

```python
print(f"Longest tracks, with artist name:")
display(
    data[['Track','Length','Artist']]
    .nlargest(3, 'Length')
    .style.hide(axis="index")
)
```

![](./Images/pandas021.png)

The following code counts the number of tracks created by each artist artist, from a random sample of artists:

```python
print(f"Number of tracks per artist, from a sample of artists::")
display(
    data
    .groupby('Artist')['Track']
    .count()
    .sample(3)
    .to_frame()
)
```

![](./Images/pandas022.png)

The following code lists the shortest tracks by the artist named "Guns N' Roses":

```python
print(f"Shortest tracks by Artist=Guns N' Roses: ")
gnr = data.loc[data.Artist == "Guns N' Roses"]
gnr_shortest = gnr[['Track','Length']].nsmallest(3, 'Length')
display(
    gnr_shortest
    .style.hide(axis="index")
)   
```

## Data analysis using SQLAlchemy queries

You may also analyze data using SQLAlchemy queries and functions. Many database engines support functions like maximum, minimum, and standard deviation. The functions supported may vary for each database engine. The SQLite database engine supports relatively few functions.

If you are writing an application that needs direct access to data from a database, you may want to see more examples of SQLAlchemy statements.

The following SQLAlchemy statements use [functions available in the SQLite database engine](https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/functions/index.php) and will display similar results to the Pandas dataframe work we did previously. 

First, write code that maps the structure of the database:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, select, func
from sqlalchemy.ext.automap import automap_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

engine = create_engine(r"sqlite:///C:/Users/blinklet/Documents/chinook-database/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite")

Base = automap_base()
Base.prepare(autoload_with=engine)

Album = Base.classes.Album
Artist = Base.classes.Artist
Customer = Base.classes.Customer
Employee = Base.classes.Employee
Genre = Base.classes.Genre
Invoice = Base.classes.Invoice
InvoiceLine = Base.classes.InvoiceLine
MediaType = Base.classes.MediaType
Playlist = Base.classes.Playlist
Track = Base.classes.Track
playlisttrack = Base.metadata.tables['PlaylistTrack']
```

Then write the folloing SQLAlchemy queries, which use database functions, and some Python functions to analyze the data in the database.

```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    statement = select(func.max(Track.Milliseconds))
    length = session.scalar(statement)
    print(f"Longest track length: {length:,.0f}")

    statement = select(func.min(Track.Milliseconds))
    length = session.scalar(statement)
    print(f"Shortest track length: {length:,.0f}")
    
    statement = select(func.count(Track.TrackId)).where(Track.Composer == None)
    composer_rows = session.scalar(statement)
    print(f"How many blanks in Composer column?: {composer_rows:,.0f}")

    statement = select(func.avg(Track.Milliseconds))
    mean = session.scalar(statement)
    print(f"Track length mean: {mean:,.0f}")
    
    from statistics import median, stdev
    statement = select(Track.Milliseconds)
    list_of_lengths = list(session.scalars(statement))
    print(f"Track length median: {median(list_of_lengths):,.0f}")
    print(f"Track length standard deviation: {stdev(list_of_lengths):,.0f}")
    
    from statistics import correlation
    statement = select(Track.UnitPrice)
    list_of_prices = list(session.scalars(statement))
    l = [int(x) for x in list_of_lengths]
    p = [int(x) for x  in list_of_prices]
    print(f"Correlation between Length and UnitPrice {correlation(l,p):,.2f}")
    
    statement = (select(Artist.Name)
                 .join_from(Track, Album)
                 .join_from(Album, Artist)
                 .group_by(Artist.Name)
                 .order_by(func.count(Artist.Name).desc()))
    mode = session.scalar(statement)
    print(f"Artist mode: {mode}")
```

The output analysis looks like the following:

```
Longest track length: 5,286,953
Shortest track length: 1,071
How many blanks in Composer column?: 978
Track length mean: 393,599
Track length median: 255,634
Track length standard deviation: 535,005
Correlation between Length and UnitPrice 0.93
Artist mode: Iron Maiden
```

We had fewer options for analyzing data natively in the database.

You can see that performing simple calculations and transformations is easier with Pandas than with the SQLAlchemy ORM's *select* methods. It is still good to learn about how to build SQL queries using the SQLAlchemy ORM. 

You will want to use complex SQL queries when you need single values from the database for your application, or when you are building your initial data set from a larger database.

# Visualizing data 

It is easy to display data visualizations when working in a Jupyter notebook. You create a dataframe containing the data you want to visualize and then use the [Pandas dataframe's *.plot()* method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html). If you want more functionality or prefer a certain style of charts, you can use one of many specialized Python visualization packages like [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

We'll run a query that gets a lot of data from the database so we can perform analysis and visualization using Pandas. We'll get data that shows the purchase history of all the tracks in our inventory, including tracks that have not sold. This is a good example of using *outer joins* that include tracks that have not been sold, so do not have corresponding entries in the InvoiceLine table.

```python
statement = (
    select(
        Customer.CustomerId,
        Customer.FirstName.label("Customer Firstname"),
        Customer.LastName.label("Customer Lastname"),
        Customer.Country,
        Track.TrackId,
        Track.Name.label("Track"),
        Album.Title.label("Album"),
        Artist.Name.label("Artist"),
        Genre.Name.label("Genre"),
        MediaType.Name.label("Media"),
        InvoiceLine.Quantity,
        InvoiceLine.UnitPrice,
        Invoice.InvoiceDate,
        Employee.EmployeeId,
        Employee.FirstName.label("Employee Firstname"),
        Employee.LastName.label("Employee Lastname")
    )
    .join_from(Track, Album)
    .join_from(Track, Genre)
    .join_from(Track, MediaType)
    .join_from(Album, Artist)
    .outerjoin_from(Track, InvoiceLine)
    .outerjoin_from(InvoiceLine, Invoice)
    .outerjoin_from(Invoice, Customer)
    .outerjoin_from(Customer, Employee)
)

dataframe = pd.read_sql_query(statement, engine)

print(dataframe.shape)
display(dataframe.tail())
```

A sample of the data in the dataframe is shown below. You can see we have 3,759 rows and that some rows contain blank data where tracks have not sold.

![](./Images/pandas030.png)

Next, create a new dataframe that groups track sales by quarter and plot the results

```python
df = (dataframe[['InvoiceDate','Quantity','UnitPrice']]
       .dropna()
       .rename(columns = {'UnitPrice':'Revenue'})
       .groupby(pd.Grouper(key="InvoiceDate", freq='3M')).sum()
       .head(-1).tail(-1)    # drop first and last period
      )

display(df.plot())
```

You should see output like:

![](./Images/pandas040.png)


Next, analyze total revenue per country:

```python
df = (dataframe[['Country','UnitPrice']]
       .rename(columns = {'UnitPrice':'Revenue'})
       .groupby(pd.Grouper(key="Country")).sum()
       .sort_values(by = 'Revenue', ascending = False)
      )

display(df.plot(kind='bar'))
```

You should see an output like:

![](./Images/pandas041.png)

Finally, see how the total number of units sold in each genre correlates with the total number of units available in each genre:

```python
df = (dataframe[['Genre','Quantity']]
       .rename(columns = {'Quantity':'# Sold'})
       .groupby("Genre", as_index=False)['# Sold'].sum()
      )

df2 = (dataframe[['Genre','TrackId']]
       .rename(columns = {'TrackId':'# Tracks available'})
       .groupby("Genre", as_index=False)["# Tracks available"].count()
      )

df3 = pd.merge(df, df2)

display(df3.plot(kind='scatter', x='# Sold', y='# Tracks available'))
```

As you can see in the scatter plot below, there appears to be a strong correlation between the number if tracks sold and the number of tracks available in each category:

# Conclusion























# Appendix A: Generate Declarative Mapping

Instead of using reflection and automap to get metadata from an existing database and automatically build the ORM, use the *[sqlacodegen](https://github.com/agronholm/sqlacodegen)* tool. It reads the structure of an existing database and generates the appropriate SQLAlchemy model code. You can then copy and paste that code into a python module and use it in your program.

Install sqlacodegen in your virtual environment. 

```powershell
> pip install --pre sqlacodegen
```

> **NOTE:** At the time I wrote this document, the stable version of *sqlacodegen* was not compatible with Python 3.11. I installed the pre-release version so it would work with Python 3.11.

Then, run the *sqlacodegen* tool against the Chinook database.

```powershell
(env) > sqlacodegen sqlite:///C:\Users\\brian\\Documents\\chinook-database\\ChinookDatabase\\DataSources\\Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite > declare_db.py
```

This creates a file named *declare_db.py* that has the following contents that builds ORM classes and tables for the Chinook database. The contents of the file should look like below:

```python

You can see how declarative mapping shows you everything you need to know about the database structure so you can use it in your program. 








# Appendix B: Exploring the database schema using the *Inspection* module




To view how tables are linked with relationships in ORM you can use the *inspect* function to look at relationship properties. Here, for example, are the relationships from the point of view of the Album table:

```python
print(f"Album table relationships")
print()
for relationship in inspect(Album).relationships:
    print(f"Relationship: {relationship}")
    print(f"Direction:    {relationship.direction}")
    print(f"Joined Table: {relationship.target}")
    print()
```
```
Album table relationships

Relationship: Album.artist
Direction:    symbol('MANYTOONE')
Joined Table: Artist

Relationship: Album.track_collection
Direction:    symbol('ONETOMANY')
Joined Table: Track
```
