Micheale Kennedy courses

refers to "@response" decorator in Flask Web App course Chapter 5 part 17
Seems some aspects are similar to [Templating Decorator Pattern](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/viewdecorators/#templating-decorator) from Flask docs

View Models comes later in that course, Chapter 13

separate get and post functions: Chapter 6 part 9
