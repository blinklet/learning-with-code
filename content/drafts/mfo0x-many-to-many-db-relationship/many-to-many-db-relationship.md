Bi-directional many-to-many relationship

From ChatGPT:
=============
Implementing a many-to-many relationship between `User` and `Profile` implies that each user can have multiple profiles and each profile can be associated with multiple users. This is common in scenarios where, for example, a profile represents a shared entity like a project or a class, and multiple users need access to it.

To set up a many-to-many relationship in Flask with SQLAlchemy, you'll need to define an association table that links users and profiles. This table essentially acts as a bridge containing foreign keys pointing to both the `User` and `Profile` tables.

### Step 1: Define the Association Table
Before defining your `User` and `Profile` models, define an association table. This is a simple table with no model class, only used for maintaining the relationship:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
user_profiles = db.Table('user_profiles',
    db.Column('user_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), primary_key=True),
    db.Column('profile_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('profile.id'), primary_key=True)
)
```

### Step 2: Modify Models to Use the Association Table
You'll now modify your `User` and `Profile` models to reference this association table in their relationships.

```python
class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    profiles = db.relationship('Profile', secondary=user_profiles, backref=db.backref('users', lazy='dynamic'))

class Profile(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    profile_name = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **`profiles` in `User` model**: This now specifies a `secondary` parameter pointing to `user_profiles`, the association table. It indicates that this relationship is mediated through the association table.
- **`users` in `Profile` model**: By using `backref`, a reverse relationship is automatically added to the `Profile` model. This allows each profile to access its associated users.

### Step 3: Working with the Many-to-Many Relationship
With the models and association table set up, you can now add and query data involving these relationships.

#### Adding Users to Profiles
Here's how you might add a user to a profile:

```python
some_user = User.query.first()
some_profile = Profile.query.first()

some_user.profiles.append(some_profile)
db.session.commit()
```

#### Querying Profiles for a User
You can retrieve all profiles associated with a specific user:

```python
user_profiles = User.query.get(some_user_id).profiles
```

#### Querying Users for a Profile
Similarly, you can find all users associated with a specific profile:

```python
profile_users = Profile.query.get(some_profile_id).users
```

### Step 4: Initializing the Application
Don't forget to initialize your Flask application and create the database tables:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

db.init_app(app)

@app.before_first_request
def create_tables():
    db.create_all()
```

This setup allows for much greater flexibility in how users and profiles interact, accommodating many realistic use cases like shared resources or group memberships.
