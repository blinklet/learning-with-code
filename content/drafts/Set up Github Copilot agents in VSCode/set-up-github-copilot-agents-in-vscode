How to use GutHub Copilot to analyze CENGN source code from Git repositories safely

## Activate GitHub subscription

To use GitHub copilot safely, do not use the free version of GitHub Copilot. You need a license that protects CENGN's data, like GitHub Copilot Business.

See the AI Tools proposal for more details about data safety.

## Check Github Copilot settings

Before you use GitHub Copilot, verify that it is configured to protect CENGN data. The "Allow GitHub to use my data for AI model training" setting should be "Disabled" by default but verify it, anyway.

You must also disable the "Allow GitHub to use my data for product improvements" setting and it is recommended that you block "Suggestions matching public code".

You need to log into your GitHub account on the GitHub web site at https://github.com, and then click on your profile in the upper right corner of the web page. Select "[Copilot Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features)". Scroll to the bottom of the settings page and verify the "block public code", "use my data", and "allow training" settings are disabled, as shown below.

## Set up GitHub Copilot in VSCode

When gettings started with AI agents, I suggest you work with code locally on your computer. This means you need to set up GitHub Copilot in your text editor, or install and use the GitHub Copilot command-line-interface on your PC.

There are two GitHub Copilot extensions in the VSCode extensions marketplace. Installing one of them seems to automatically install both. The results in your extensions panel should look like:

## Get the code from remote repository

Clone your project repository from its repositorty hosted on GitHub, or any other repository services, like GitLab or BitBucket.

```bash
cd ~ mkdir Projects 
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/blinklet/music-festival-organizer.git
```

## Open project in VSCode

After cloning all the repository to your computer, open it in VSCode as follows:

1. In VSCode, go to _File_ --> _Open Folder..._
2. Navigate to the repository folder (which is _music-festival-organizer_ in this example)
3. Click _Open_

All subfolders in the repository folder will appear in VSCode's side bar. Verify that VSCode is managing these in a git repository:

1. Click on the Source Control icon in the activity bar
2. You should see a list of repositories. Select one of them.
3. Click on the Graph panel in the Source Control side bar

Now you should see the git history of the repository. To see what has been changed in each commit, select the commit tag then click on the filenames that were part of the commit. You'll see the diff showing the changes. See the screenshot below.

## Check the .gitignore file

There's a good chance I'll need to create a Python virtual environment in the repository folder to support any AI agents you create (they like to write their own helper scripts in Python). Copy the text from the ![_Python.gitignore_ file available on GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) and append it to your local _.gitignore_ file (It's too long to display here). Save the file.

In VSCode's Source Control side panel, add the .gitignore file to the main branch and commit the change. Now you can track changes to the file, if an agent changes it. 

## GitHub Copilot Chat

To get started, use GitHib Copilot chat. Select one of the models that has a "zero" multiplier so that your chat does not use up any of your limited number of premium requests. In this example, I will use _GPT5-mini_. 

To select the model, select it from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the chat bar, as shown below:

![GitHub security settings]({attach}./images/pick-model-1.png){ width=90% }

I fooled around for a bit. I eventually decided that the zero-multiplier models were not giving me the results I wanted. I was more satisfied by the models that use "premium requests". 

## Generate Copilot instructions

Click on the "new Chat" icon at the top if the chat panel. It looks like a Plus sign. This creates a new chat panel that displays a link to "Generate Agent Instructions".

Change the agent from "Ask" to "Agent". Change the AI model to "Gemini Pro", and then click on the "Generate Agent Instructions" instructions link.

![Generate GitHub Copilot Instructions]({attach}./images/generate-copilot-instructions){ width=90% }

The new agent will create a hidden folder named _.github_ and create an instructions file named _copilot-instructions.md_ that contains information about your project that future agents can use as context.

You can keep the changes to the file, undo the changes, or edit the suggested changes. Then, save the file.

![Copilot Instructions File]({attach}./images/generate-copilot-instructions-2){ width=90% }

The _copilot-instructions.md_ file is a living document and you should update it as you learn more about the code, or to guide development in the way you prefer.

### Terminology

VSCode used some confusing terms earlier. If you need to create similar instructions for another repo you might use the command pallet and select _Chat:Generate Workspace Instructions File_. This is the same thing as the "Generate Agent Instructions" instructions link in a new chat panel in VSCode.

## Create Copilot agents in VSCode

The [GitHub Copilot user documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) is a good place to learn about  creating and using agents. See also the [Awesome-Copilot repo](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/agents) for examples of agent files. Github has a page that describes how to do [specification-driven development](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).

Each user will have their own needs. In my case, I want an expert in Python who will use specific frameworks to continue development of this project. So, I will create my own custom agent tailored to my needs.

Note on models: Different ML models produce different results. For example, _Claude Sonnet 4.5_ creates very long, detailed files while _Google Gemini 3 Pro_ creates shorter files. When creating an agent, I found shorter files with less direction work better. Long detailed agent descriptions seem to restrict the output generated and you start to see a lot of text in responses that is just copied from the agent description. So, I used Google Gemini 3 Pro to help me create my agent.

So, I selected the "Gemini 3 Pro" model in Agent mode and told it to do the following:

```
Propose an python-web.agent.md file that creates an agent who can effectively program in this project, using the most up-to-date versions of the framewokrs used, but is free to also propose the use of other frameworks, if they better suite the perceived requirements.
```

This produced a file _.github/agents/python-web,agent.md_ file that describes the behaviour of a Python co-programming agent, tuned to the needs of my project. It wasn't perfect, so I had to add a few lines, but it was a great starting point for building an agent.

Now, the new _Python-web_ agent appears in VSCode's agents list. 

![New agent]({attach}./images/python-web-agent.md){ width=90% }

## Using the agent

Now that the agent is configured with specific knowledge of the project's stack (Flask, SQLAlchemy 2.0, etc.) and goals (to use HTMX, Pydantic, etc.), we can give it high-level tasks and ask it to write code that matches the project's requirements.

Some example scenarios:

* The python-web agent was instructed to use _SQLAlchemy 2.0_ syntax and to use the modern *select* statements instead of the older *query* statement. We can use this to refactor legacy code or write new, compliant queries.
* The python-web agent knows I want to avoid complex JavaScript frameworks in favour of HTMX. So I can ask it to add dynamic features and it will avoid generating JavaScript code that I cannot understand.
* The python-web agent is encouraged to use Pydantic for data validation, so I could ask it to improve my spreadsheet import logic.
* I could ask the agent to create tests for the application using Pytest.
